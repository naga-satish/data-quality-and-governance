# Phase 1: Introduction to Data Quality

## Objective
Understand what data quality is, why it matters, and its core dimensions.

## 1. What is Data Quality?

### Definition
Data quality measures how well a dataset meets criteria for **accuracy, completeness, reliability, and fitness for use**.

### Why It Matters
- Poor data quality leads to:
  - Incorrect analytics and flawed ML models.
  - Bad business decisions (e.g., misguided marketing campaigns).
  - Compliance risks (e.g., GDPR violations).
  - Reduced operational efficiency and customer trust.
- **Example**:
  A healthcare dataset with missing patient ages could skew clinical trial results.

## 2. Key Dimensions of Data Quality

| Dimension       | Description                                                                 | Example                                                                 |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Accuracy**    | Data correctly represents real-world values.                                | Patient's recorded weight: 70kg (actual weight: 70kg).                 |
| **Completeness**| No missing values in critical fields.                                      | All orders must have a `customer_id`.                                   |
| **Consistency** | Uniform format/rules across datasets.                                      | Dates stored as `YYYY-MM-DD` (no mixed formats).                        |
| **Timeliness**  | Data is up-to-date and available when needed.                              | Delayed stock prices are useless for real-time trading.                 |
| **Uniqueness**  | No duplicate records.                                                      | A customer listed twice due to a merge error.                           |
| **Validity**    | Data conforms to defined rules (e.g., ranges, regex).                      | `email` field must match `*@domain.com`.                               |

## 3. Common Data Quality Issues

| Issue            | Description                              | Example                                  |
|------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Missing Values**| Nulls/empty fields in critical columns. | `order_date` is null for 5% of records. |
| **Duplicates**   | Repeated records.                        | Same transaction logged twice.          |
| **Outliers**     | Values far from the norm.                | A $1M purchase in a retail dataset.     |
| **Schema Mismatches** | Column type changes.               | `price` stored as string instead of float. |

- *"Data Quality: The Field Guide"* by Thomas Redman (covers governance).

### Hands-On Practice
1. **Kaggle Datasets**:  
   Analyze [TMDB Movies](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata) for:
   - Missing budgets.
   - Duplicate titles.
   - Inconsistent genres.

2. **Python/Pandas Profiling**:
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   from pandas_profiling import ProfileReport

   df = pd.read_csv("your_data.csv")
   profile = ProfileReport(df, title="Data Quality Report")
   profile.to_file("report.html")  # Identifies nulls, duplicates, stats
   ```
### Key Takeaways
   - Data quality is about fitness for use – align checks with business goals.
   - Start with profiling (Pandas, OpenRefine) to identify issues.
   - Use dimensions (accuracy, completeness, etc.) to categorize problems.
